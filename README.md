public/                        # Static assets served by Next.js
```

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js 20+** (Next.js 15 requires modern runtimes)
- **npm 10+**
- **OpenAI API Key** (get one from [https://platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone and Install

Install dependencies and initialize Husky hooks:

```powershell
npm install
```

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

Copy the `.env.local` file and add your OpenAI API key:

```powershell
# .env.local
LLM_PROVIDER=openai
LLM_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini
TIMEOUT_MS=15000
MAX_TOKENS=5120
RETRIES=2
```

⚠️ **Important**: Without a valid `LLM_API_KEY`, the application will fall back to deterministic summaries instead of AI-generated insights.

### 3. Start Development Server

Start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 4. Load a Dataset

1. Navigate to the home page
2. Click "Select Dataset" or "Upload Dataset"
3. Use the provided sample dataset at `SampleData/hosts_dataset.json`
4. Browse hosts and request AI-powered summaries

## How to Run the Project

```

Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to access the application.

### Production Build

```powershell
npm run build
npm run start
```

### Combined Build & Preview

```powershell
npm run preview
```

This builds and immediately serves the production bundle on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Testing Instructions

### Automated Tests

Run the test suite with Vitest:

```powershell
# Run all tests once
npm test

# Watch mode for development
npm run test:watch
```

Current test coverage includes:
- **Schema Validation Tests**: Verify Zod schemas handle valid and invalid host data
- **Dataset Loader Tests**: Ensure JSON parsing and caching work correctly
- **Dataset Resolver Tests**: Test normalization and risk scoring logic
- **Action Tests**: Validate server action behavior and error handling
- **Smoke Tests**: Basic application health checks

### Manual Testing

#### Test 1: Dataset Loading
1. Start the dev server (`npm run dev`)
2. Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
3. Click "Select Dataset"
4. Choose `SampleData/hosts_dataset.json`
5. **Expected**: Should see a list of hosts with IPs, locations, and risk badges

#### Test 2: AI Summarization (Requires API Key)
1. Load a dataset (as above)
2. Click on any host IP to view details
3. Click "Generate Summary" button
4. **Expected**: Should see AI-generated highlights, risks, and narrative within ~5-15 seconds
5. **Verify**: Summary should be specific to the host's vulnerabilities and services

#### Test 3: Fallback Mode (No API Key)
1. Remove or invalidate `LLM_API_KEY` in `.env.local`
2. Restart the server
3. Request a summary
4. **Expected**: Should see a deterministic summary with a "missing-config" error message
5. **Verify**: Summary still shows useful information derived from host data

#### Test 4: Error Handling
1. Set `LLM_API_KEY` to an invalid value
2. Request a summary
3. **Expected**: Should gracefully fail with an error message and show fallback summary
4. **Verify**: Application doesn't crash, user gets actionable feedback

#### Test 5: Batch Summarization
1. Load a dataset with multiple hosts
2. Navigate to the hosts list page
3. Click "Summarize All" (if implemented)
4. **Expected**: Should see progressive updates as summaries complete
5. **Verify**: Individual failures don't block other summaries

### Testing the OpenAI Integration

To verify the OpenAI API is being called:

1. **Check Console Logs**: Look for API errors or fallback messages in the terminal
2. **Use OpenAI Dashboard**: Visit [https://platform.openai.com/usage](https://platform.openai.com/usage) to see API usage
3. **Compare Summaries**: AI summaries should be more natural and varied than fallback summaries
4. **Test Malformed Data**: Send edge cases to verify validation and error handling

## Quality Gates

All quality scripts are wired together and run automatically via the pre-commit hook:

- `npm run lint` – ESLint with the Next.js + Prettier configuration.
- `npm run type-check` – Strict TypeScript compilation with no emit.
- `npm test` – Vitest suite (currently includes schema, loader, and action tests).
- `npm run format` / `npm run format:write` – Verify or apply Prettier formatting.

Husky ensures `lint`, `type-check`, and `test` succeed before a commit lands.

## AI Techniques Implemented

### 1. **Prompt Engineering**

The application uses sophisticated prompt construction (`src/server/prompts/hostPrompt.ts`) to:
- **Context Optimization**: Intelligently truncates banners, CVE descriptions, and labels to fit token budgets
- **Structured Output**: Forces JSON responses with specific schema (`highlights`, `risks`, `narrative`)
- **Domain-Specific Instructions**: Cybersecurity-focused system prompts for expert-level analysis
- **Token Budget Management**: Ensures prompts never exceed `MAX_TOKENS` configuration

### 2. **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pattern**

While not using a vector database, the system implements RAG principles:
- **Data Normalization**: Pre-processes raw Censys data into structured, prompt-friendly formats
- **Selective Context**: Only includes relevant host information in prompts (not entire dataset)
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Augments raw data with derived metrics (risk scores, service counts, TLS flags)
- **Fallback Knowledge**: Maintains deterministic summaries as ground truth for comparison

### 3. **Error Classification & Recovery**

Intelligent error handling with retry strategies:
- **Error Taxonomy**: Classifies failures as `timeout`, `rate-limit`, `transient`, `provider`, `invalid-response`, etc.
- **Conditional Retries**: Only retries transient errors, not configuration or authentication failures
- **Exponential Backoff**: Respects `Retry-After` headers from OpenAI API
- **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to deterministic summaries on persistent failures

### 4. **Response Validation & Parsing**

Ensures AI outputs meet quality standards:
- **Schema Validation**: Uses Zod to validate LLM responses match expected structure
- **JSON Extraction**: Handles markdown code blocks and formatting inconsistencies
- **Format Normalization**: Cleans responses before parsing
- **Type Safety**: Guarantees type correctness throughout the pipeline

### 5. **Concurrency Control**

Manages parallel AI requests efficiently:
- **Batch Processing**: Processes multiple hosts with controlled concurrency (default: 3)
- **Streaming Results**: Uses async generators for progressive UI updates
- **Abort Signals**: Supports cancellation for long-running operations
- **Timeout Management**: Per-request timeouts prevent hung connections

### 6. **Risk Assessment Algorithm**

Multi-source risk scoring system:
- **Priority-Based Aggregation**: Combines vulnerability severity, CVSS scores, and threat intelligence
- **Deterministic Ranking**: Consistent `vulnerability` → `threat_intel` → `vulnerability_cvss` priority
- **Source Attribution**: Tracks which signals contributed to final risk assessment
- **Normalization**: Standardizes risk levels across different data sources

## Assumptions Made During Development

### Data Assumptions

1. **Dataset Structure**: Assumed the Censys dataset follows the schema provided in `SampleData/hosts_dataset.json`
2. **IP Uniqueness**: Assumed each IP in the dataset is unique (no duplicate hosts)
3. **Data Completeness**: Assumed optional fields may be missing but required fields are always present
4. **Timestamp Format**: Assumed `created_at` is always in ISO-8601 format
5. **CVSS Scores**: Assumed CVSS scores are on a 0-10 scale when present

### API Assumptions

1. **OpenAI Availability**: Assumed OpenAI API is accessible and responds within timeout windows
2. **JSON Mode**: Assumed GPT-4o-mini can reliably produce JSON with proper system prompts (not using native JSON mode)
3. **Token Limits**: Assumed 5120 tokens is sufficient for detailed security summaries
4. **Rate Limits**: Assumed reasonable rate limits (implemented retry logic to handle this)
5. **Model Availability**: Assumed `gpt-4o-mini` remains available (easily swappable via env var)

### User Experience Assumptions

1. **Dataset Size**: Assumed datasets contain 10-500 hosts (not thousands)
2. **Network Conditions**: Assumed reasonable internet connectivity for API calls
3. **Browser Support**: Assumed modern browsers with JavaScript enabled
4. **User Knowledge**: Assumed users have basic cybersecurity knowledge to interpret summaries
5. **Single User**: Designed for single-user operation (no authentication or multi-tenancy)

### Technical Assumptions

1. **Server-Only Execution**: Assumed all LLM calls execute server-side (Next.js Server Actions)
2. **No Database**: Assumed in-memory caching is sufficient (no persistent storage)
3. **Stateless Sessions**: Assumed no need for session management or user persistence
4. **Local Development**: Primarily optimized for local development (not production-scale deployment)
5. **Environment Variables**: Assumed `.env.local` file contains all necessary configuration

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and populate it with real provider credentials. All variables are read strictly on the server within server actions so no keys ever leak into the client bundle.

| Variable | Description | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LLM_PROVIDER` | Identifier for the upstream model provider (e.g., `openai`, `azure-openai`). | `openai` |
| `LLM_API_KEY` | Secret API key used to authenticate summarization requests. Summaries fall back to deterministic heuristics when this is missing. | _required for live calls_ |
| `MODEL_NAME` | Provider-specific model identifier used for summaries. | `gpt-4o-mini` |
| `TIMEOUT_MS` | Per-request timeout applied to LLM calls. | `15000` |
| `MAX_TOKENS` | Token budget for summaries, applied by the eventual provider integration. | `512` |
| `RETRIES` | Number of retry attempts for transient provider failures. | `2` |

These variables are consumed exclusively inside server modules under `src/server`, keeping the trust boundary intact.

## Dataset

The canonical dataset lives at `SampleData/hosts_dataset.json` and is committed verbatim so behaviour stays deterministic across development, demos, and tests. Server code should read it through the utilities in `src/server/dataset.ts`, which validate the payload with the Zod schemas under `src/server/schema.ts`.

### Field coverage

- `metadata`
  - `description` – freeform summary of the dataset scope.
  - `created_at` – ISO-8601 date string marking snapshot time.
  - `data_sources` – array of source identifiers (always at least one).
  - `hosts_count` – total hosts represented.
  - `ips_analyzed` – array of IPs used for quick lookup in docs/tests.
- `hosts[]`
  - `ip` – IPv4 address.
  - `location` – city/country strings (optional), ISO country code, and `coordinates { latitude, longitude }` (both required).
  - `autonomous_system` – `asn`, owning `name`, and optional ISO `country_code`.
  - `dns` _(optional)_ – `hostname` string when reverse DNS is available.
  - `operating_system` _(optional)_ – detected `vendor`, `product`, optional `version`.
  - `services[]` – always present but normalised to `[]` if absent.
    - `port`/`protocol` – numeric port and service protocol string.
    - `banner` _(optional)_ – raw banner response.
    - `software[]` _(optional)_ – product/vendor/version triples discovered in banners.
    - `vulnerabilities[]` _(optional)_ – CVE id, severity, optional CVSS score/description.
    - `malware_detected` _(optional)_ – malware family name, type, confidence (0-1), and `threat_actors[]` labels.
    - `authentication_required`, `tls_enabled`, `access_restricted` – boolean flags for interaction requirements.
    - `certificate` _(optional)_ – TLS fingerprint, subject/issuer, optional SANs, `self_signed` indicator.
    - `response_details` _(optional)_ – HTTP status code with optional title/content language.
    - `error_message` _(optional)_ – service error banner (e.g., MySQL access rejection).
  - `threat_intelligence` _(optional)_ –
    - `security_labels[]` defaults to `[]` when missing.
    - `malware_families[]` optional array of known families.
    - `risk_level` string describing overall host risk.

### Loader utilities

`src/server/dataset.ts` exposes:

- `loadHostsDataset()` – reads and validates the JSON once, caching the typed result for reuse.
- `loadHosts()` – convenience helper returning just the hosts array.
- `loadNormalizedHosts()` – returns hosts augmented with derived metrics for prompts and UI filters.
- `getLoaderIssues()` – surfaces any validation warnings produced while tolerating partial records.
- `resetHostsDatasetCache()` – clears the in-memory cache for tests.

### Normalization outputs

The normalization step (`src/server/normalize.ts`) precomputes prompt-friendly signals for each host so server components and future LLM actions avoid runtime aggregation:

- Risk scoring via `riskBadge`, produced by `getRiskBadge`, which deterministically selects the highest severity from vulnerability aggregates, CVSS-derived levels, and `threat_intelligence.risk_level` (falling back to `informational` when only labels exist).
- Protocol and port breakdowns (`serviceCountsByProtocol`, `openPorts`) to power quick filters.
- TLS insights (`tlsEnabledCount`, `hasCertificates`, `hasSelfSignedCertificate`).
- Vulnerability summaries including `maxSeverity`, `highestCvss`, and deduplicated `top` CVEs.
- Threat context (`securityLabels`, `malwareFamilies`, `detectedMalwareNames`, `threatActors`).
- Representative banners and software fingerprints for succinct summarization prompts.

Risk badges are ordered using a fixed priority (`vulnerability` → `threat_intel` → `vulnerability_cvss`) so ties resolve predictably, and the resulting `sources` array documents which signals contributed to the final label.

All server actions and parsers should route through these helpers to guarantee consistent validation.

## Summarization Actions

`src/server/actions/summarizeHost.ts` implements a server-only action that accepts a `NormalizedHost`, builds a schema-aware prompt, and executes provider calls with timeouts, retries, and structured error handling. Results return `{ highlights[], risks[], narrative, errorKind }`, ensuring callers can differentiate missing configuration, timeouts, or provider issues.

`src/server/actions/summarizeAll.ts` iterates through hosts with modest concurrency (default 3), yielding incremental results via an async iterator so UIs can stream batch summaries without blocking. Each item reuses `summarizeHost`, carries the originating host/index, and continues even when individual hosts fail.

`src/server/prompts/hostPrompt.ts` houses versioned prompt builders (`HOST_PROMPT_VERSION`) that keep inputs under provider token budgets by truncating banners, CVE descriptions, and threat labels while still surfacing IP, geo/ASN context, protocol counts, TLS flags, and malware signals. Guardrails ensure prompts never exceed the configured `MAX_TOKENS`, and summarization errors classify rate-limit vs transient failures so the UI can communicate deterministic retry guidance.

## Accessibility & UI

The default landing page demonstrates the agent with semantic regions (`header`, `main`, `section`), a skip link for keyboard navigation, and visible focus states derived from the shared design system in `globals.css`. Severity indicators combine icons with text badges so status is legible without relying on color alone, matching the yellow/gold accent cues in the target styling.
